## Instructions

#### `Netlify`
If you want to see the current version of the application working now, 
it is running at https://vuttr-diogo.netlify.app. All functions can be used normally.
The backend is hosted on heroku.

#### `Run Local`
You will not be able to run the application correctly because it needs a specific API link in the .env file to receive the data. But if you want to run anyway, just follow the steps below.

Clone down this repository. You will need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.  

Installation:

`npm install`   

To Start Server:

`npm start`  

To Visit App:

`localhost:3000`
