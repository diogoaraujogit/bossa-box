# VUTTR
## Very Useful Tools To Remember

The application is a simple repository for managing tools with their names, 
links, descriptions and tags.

## Getting started

### `Running local`

You can clone the repository or download the files to test yourself locally.
In the local repository, insert your backend api link in the variable available 
in the .env file and then run `yarn && yarn start`
The application must be running on localhost, on the designated port.

### `Netlify`

If you want to see the current version of the application working now, 
it is running at https://vuttr-diogo.netlify.app. All functions can be used normally.
The backend is hosted on heroku.
